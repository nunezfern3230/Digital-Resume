## Follow the below steps to deploy your own resume

1. clone repo `git clone https://github.com/divanov11/Digital-Resume` 
    * Make sure you update content to represent your information 
3. Create a new github repo
4. Commit and push to github.

```
git add .
git commit -m "your commit notes"
git push -u origin main
```

4. Publish with github pages

Once you've added your project to GitHub, you can publish by going to the `settings` tab from your repo (this should be in the top right corner), then select `pages` (this should be towards the bottom left).

From here make sure you have "deploy from branch" selected and save your settings. Once saved, it should take a few minutes to generate and display your new live GitHub pages url.



Here‚Äôs a **GitHub README section layout** that showcases your two resumes, includes both visuals, and explains the process.
You can paste this directly into your `README.md` file (and just update the image paths/links if hosting them elsewhere).

## üìÑ Digital Resume Project

This project demonstrates **two approaches** to building a digital resume and hosting it online with **GitHub Pages**:

1. **Forked Template:** Adapted from an existing GitHub project for quick setup and learning.
2. **Custom Build:** Designed from scratch for a fully personalized experience.

### üìå Key Takeaways

* **Forking a template** is great for quick results and learning HTML/CSS through hands-on editing.
* **Building from scratch** allows for total creative control, a cleaner codebase, and a resume that truly reflects you.
* **GitHub Pages** makes it easy to publish and share your resume for free.

If you‚Äôd like, Emma, I can also create a **short, friendly ‚ÄúAbout this Project‚Äù paragraph** for the very top of your README that sets the tone before the process explanation ‚Äî kind of like a portfolio intro blurb.
Do you want me to make that too?
